            <h2>Previous Knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              <b>I knew about these tools before the class. I have even used them.</b> I had no idea what I was doing. So,
              I built my first website in the 90's and made a e-commerce site for a company I worked at. That was all
              before the turn of the century. 
            </p><br>
            <p>My skills sat on the shelf until I got introduced to XML. I used XML in my programming experiences. But HTML 
              became stale to me. Later, I picked up the relationships with CSS and Javascript, but again, didn't study it 
              or even try to understand it until this class. Of the three, CSS is the most difficult for me to pick up.

            <h2>Template or From Scratch</h2>
            <p>
              I started from scratch. Every page I built from the ground up. So, it feels good to come up with an idea,
              and be able to produce an output. But to say that I know how all this works isn't true. I'm using the
              tried and true method of searching for how to do something and then putting it into my code. For instance,
              I asked Chat GPT how I could put the tree in the footer and have the words float over the center with a
              little shadow. This is what I got.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              There are starter templates all over the place and for a professional or clean look, I might chase this 
              path in the future. But <b>I wanted to come up with a theme and run with it.</b> This allowed me to pick the 
              color schemes (which involved looking at what colors look good together). I also used a bit of AI to 
              generate images and Paint.NET for editing images. Taylor Made is something you can take pride in.

            <h2>Most Challenging Part</h2>
            <p>
              <b>CSS is still a mystery.</b> I'm not in favor of heirarchy style (cascading style) "programming." Because
              you can fight and fight and fight to make an element behave only to find that it is being overwritten by
              something else down the page. That is frustrating to me and a big time waster. I'm sure experience will
              make this better. And I am glad that I'm learning. But, wow, the countless modifications that do nothing
              until I literally rip out tons of code before figuring out the issue. UGH!!

            <h2>Changed View on Web Development</h2>
            <p>
              As mentioned before, I have previous experience. But it is very much from the days when you built your web
              site with the idea that people would be looking at it with an 800x600 pixel resolution. The goal was to get
              everything important visible on the first page in that space. I remember the first smart phone we got had a
              scroll ball built in so we could move the mouse on a website and see the menus/submenus and flyover text.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Responsive websites have changed all that. The ADA also plays in, and the advancements in HTML have made it
              so much more accessible for everyone on most any device. I'm excited that I was able to get this far and 
              understand a lot of what I was doing. Now I feel more confident if I ever do go and use a template to 
              really make my site jazzy!

            <h2>Advice for Future Students</h2>
            <p>
              If you look at my home page, I wrote it before doing the website. Meaning, <b>make a plan!</b> Then after
              getting the framework up and running, you can modify your plan to suit your needs. Most designs start on a
              whiteboard. Especially if they are of any significant size.

              Don't freak out over the grades you get during class. It will all come back together.
